# Ocdamia-Music-Group
Live band means music, live or recorded, provided at a place of public entertainment, whether or not accompanied by any form of dancing including cabaret. Live performances provide a platform for musicians to reach new listeners and turn those in the audience into fans [ocdamiamusicgroup](https://ocdamiamusicgroup.com/), which is perhaps the most important thing any artist can do. DJs will be able to play music for at least five hours with little to no breaks. Bands, on the other hand, may only be able to play a maximum of four to five hours including breaks. Depending on the timeframe of your event, one option may be better than the other.
